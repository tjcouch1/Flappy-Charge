# Flappy-Charge
An unfinished game made in the last few moments of the Honors Game Jam 2017

I didn't have a ton of time to spend in development during HGJ17 because I organized and advised most of the time. I tried to make a little game in the last little bit, but I didn't quite finish the programming in the thirty minutes or so I spent on it. I fixed it up later to make it a playable game. It's just a little flappy bird clone with a charge ability (the theme for the jam was "Charge"). I didn't make any assets for it.
