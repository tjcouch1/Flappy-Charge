# Flappy-Charge
Honors Game Jam 2017 flappy scroller game

I didn't have much time to spend in development during HGJ17 because I organized and advised most of the time. I tried to make a little game in the last little bit, but I didn't quite finish the programming in the thirty minutes or so I spent on it. I fixed it up later to make it a playable game. It's the obligatory flappy bird clone! Your bird has a charge ability (the theme for the jam was "Charge").
